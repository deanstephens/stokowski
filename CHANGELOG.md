## [Unreleased]

### Added

- feat: **clearer Slack gate threads** — approve/rework actions now post an attributed, visually-separated message in the thread: a `divider` block followed by e.g. `:leftwards_arrow_with_hook: *Sent back for rework* — by @alice` (@-mentioning the actor when their Slack id is known). Makes it easy to tell where one review round ends and the next begins. The actor is also recorded as a thread participant for follow-up pings.
- feat: **targeted Slack mentions** (`slack.mentions: true`) — @-mention the Linear issue creator at the review gate, and ping everyone who replied in the gate thread on follow-ups (agent reply, re-review gate, error, done). Linear users are matched to Slack users by email (`users.lookupByEmail`, cached) with an optional `slack.user_map` override; requires scopes `users:read` + `users:read.email`. Default off.
- feat: **conversational review gates** — a Slack thread reply runs a read-only agent turn (resumes the issue's session, tools limited to Read/Grep/Glob) and posts the reply back into the thread. The exchange is persisted to `<workspace>/.stokowski/conversation.jsonl` and injected into later stage prompts so rework/merge inherit the discussion.
- feat: **two-way Slack integration** — pushes human-review gates (with Approve / Request rework buttons), agent questions, error/stall escalations, and run-completion notices to a channel. Button clicks and thread replies drive the existing Linear gate states. Configure under `slack:` (`enabled`, `bot_token`, `signing_secret`, `channel`, `events`). New module `stokowski/slack.py`; inbound endpoints `/slack/interactivity` and `/slack/events` (verified with the Slack signing secret).
- feat: **interactive remote terminals** — open a live tmux-backed shell into any issue's workspace from the dashboard (`/terminal/<id>`, websocket PTY bridge at `/ws/terminal/<id>`). New module `stokowski/terminal.py`. Requires `tmux` on the host.
- feat: agent Claude Code session ids are now persisted to `.stokowski/session` in each workspace — sessions survive orchestrator restarts and can be resumed from inside the terminal (`claude --resume "$(cat .stokowski/session)"`).
- feat: **dashboard bearer-token auth** (`server.auth_token` / `--auth-token` / `$STOKOWSKI_AUTH_TOKEN`). Stokowski refuses to bind a non-loopback host without a token unless `--insecure` is passed. Slack callback routes are exempt (signing-secret auth).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- feat: auto-start the web dashboard when `server.port` is set in config — no `--port` flag required; adds `server.host` config and a `--host` CLI flag (8f50d3b)
- feat: structured logging that tags log records with the issue they relate to via a `linked_to` field (66366fc)
- feat: show last-activity timestamps for running agents in both the dashboard and CLI status table (7611621)
- feat: live log panel in the dashboard — server-sent-events log stream with per-issue filtering, auto-scroll, and clear (008e121)

### Fixed

- fix: guard `server.host` resolution against an unloaded config so invalid configs fail with the clean startup error instead of an AttributeError (#38)
- fix: reconcile gates against Linear truth on each tick and at startup (#24)
- fix: route gate-approve through `_transition` for proper target-type dispatch (#22)
- fix: read blocker from `IssueRelation.issue`, not `relatedIssue` (#21)

### Changed

- fix: responsive font sizes in the dashboard using rem units and a width breakpoint (4fba2c7)

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- feat: pass workflow.yaml Linear credentials (`api_key`, `project_slug`, `endpoint`) to agent subprocesses as env vars — agents now use the same Linear credentials as Stokowski without relying on shell environment (770206c)

### Changed

- docs: workflow.yaml is now the single source of truth for Linear credentials — removed `.env.example` and updated README setup guide (a9ed097)
- docs: update README intro to position Stokowski as building beyond Symphony (a9ed097)

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- feat: add todo state — pick up issues from Todo and move to In Progress automatically (94b9d02)

### Fixed

- fix: single turn per dispatch in state machine mode — agents no longer blow past stage boundaries (ee8f0f6)
- fix: prevent re-dispatch loop when gate state transition fails — keep issue claimed and retry (60f391f)
- fix: include lifecycle context in multi-turn continuation prompts (ca82942)
- fix: increase subprocess stdout buffer to 10MB to handle large NDJSON lines (a346125)
- fix: check return value of `update_issue_state` at all call sites (6347584)
- fix: Linear 400 on state update — use `team.states` instead of `workflowStates` filter (77a0bad)
- fix: make `_SilentUndefined` inherit from `jinja2.Undefined` (1b6ddb3)
- fix: read `__version__` from package metadata instead of hardcoded string (ae74016)

---

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- feat: add todo state — pick up issues from Todo and move to In Progress automatically (94b9d02)

### Fixed

- fix: read `__version__` from package metadata instead of hardcoded string — update checker now shows correct version (ae74016)

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- fix: exclude `prompts/` from setuptools package discovery — fresh installs failed with "Multiple top-level packages" error (de001b4)
- fix: `project.license` deprecation warning — switched to SPDX string format (de001b4)

### Changed

- docs: rewrite Emdash comparison for accuracy — now an open-source desktop app with 22+ agent CLIs (15d15d4)
- docs: expand "What Stokowski adds beyond Symphony" with state machine, multi-runner, and prompt assembly sections (15d15d4)
- docs: clarify workflow diagram is a configurable example, not a fixed pipeline (f9879b6)

---

### Added

- docs: example `workflow.yaml` and `prompts/*.example.md` files (da63359, da7d8bb)

### Fixed

- fix: gate claiming, duplicate comments, crash recovery, codex timeout (8f2ac3f)
- fix: transition key mismatch — example config used `success`, orchestrator expected `complete` (b18da0a)
- fix: use `<br/>` for line breaks in Mermaid node labels (754711f)

### Changed

- refactor: `WORKFLOW.md` (YAML front matter + prompt body) replaced by `workflow.yaml` + `prompts/` directory (c0109d9)
- refactor: `TrackerConfig.active_states` / `terminal_states` replaced by `LinearStatesConfig` mapping (c0109d9)
